### pridestrips

Have you ever thought to yourself, *the overworld just doesn't have enough pride flag*?
Well you're now in luck! This mod adds two strips of colored blocks forming pride flags across the overworld. Currently the mod adds 7 flags, attached to certain biomes: 

 - Trans Flag: Birch Forest, Flower Forest, Old Growth Birch Forest:
 - Ace Flag: Sunflower Plains, Lush Caves
 - Non-binary Flag: Old Growth Pine Taiga, Old Growth Spruce Taiga
 - Bi Flag: Desert, Dark Forest 
 - Agender Flag: Grove, Jungle, Sparse Jungle
 - Aro Flag: Badlands, Bamboo Jungle 
 - General 7-stripe: All other biomes

Please note - the biome rarity / distribution of flags is not meant to be any sort of comment on validity. If you think the biome layout should be different, raise an issue on my Github, or send me a note on discord at snoozestudios#1591. Also, this mod is still in alpha, and that is because I will work to add as many flags as possible! Have no doubt, I stand with you in your identity :)
